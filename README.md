# Moleca

Moleca (Mode-less convolution algorithm) is a numerical method to compute the complex spectral density matrix (CSDM) of a well collimated beam through an optical system with a high Numerical Aperture. The beam is assumed to be an electromagnetic Schell model beam, with a spectral degree of coherence which depends only on the difference of coordinates and a spectral amplitude depending just on one set of coordinates.
